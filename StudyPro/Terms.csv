Abstract class,"A class that can only be a base class, in other words you can't create an instance of, but can inherit from it.

It is used to define variables and functions that multiple classes have in common. The primary difference is that the base class does NOT have enough information to be a fully functioning class. A class MUST inherit from  it and override any abstract methods to make it usable.",C#,
Abstract method,A method with no implementation. It is declared in an abstract class or interface; any concrete (non-abstract) class that extends the abstract class must override the abstract method and provide an implementation for it,C#,
Abstraction,"When the user/system only has access to what they need to know and the rest of the program's inner workings are hidden. 

This is generally accomplished through public methods of a class (Encapsulation) or with the use of public interfaces (Interface or Base Classes).

Annotation / Attribute,"An Attribute in .NET (or Annotation in Java) is a way to mark or flag parts of your code. It is used to indicate that certain classes or functions should be treated differently.

Attributes can added to Classes, Namespaces, Functions, Properties and other structures.

They are used extensively in UnitTesting and in ASP.NET WebAPI

[TestClass]
[Test]
[HttpGet]",C#,
API,"API stands for Application Programming Interface

A piece of software that acts as an interface through which two programs can interact with one another.

In recent years the term API has become synonymous with Web APIs, but an API is not limited to being accessible only through the web.

A WebAPI is a way to expose functions to the internet so that they can be called by anyone who needs access to that functionality.",C#,
Argument,"When you write a function you create a signature. The signature specifies the input parameters that are required to use that function. 

When you make a call to the function you need to pass a value to each input parameter. This is called an argument. So the terms parameter and argument are often used interchangably.

In other words:
Parameter: the term used for variables defined by the function signature
Argument: the term used for the value being passed to a function
",C#,
Array,"An array is a data structure that stores a list of objects of the same data type.

It is a list of fixed length, meaning that you cannot change the size of the array once it has been created. If you need to changes the size, you need to create a new array, and copy all of the existing elements into it.

Array memory is contiguous, meaning that all elements in the array are stored side by side. This makes them efficient.

An array is ordered, meaning that you can access any element of the array by index position.",Data Structures,
ArrayList,"A list is a data structure that stores a list of objects of the same data type. It is one of the structures found in the Collections namespace in .NET.

It is a list of variable length, meaning that you CAN change the size of the list by adding new elements to the list once it has been created.

.NET Collections have variousl implementations of the IList interface. Like an array, a List (ArrayList in Java) stores data contiguously in memory. And it manages the resizing (re-creation) of the array as it needs to grow.

A List is ordered, meaning that you can access any element of the array by index position.",Data Structures,
Assertion,"An assertion is a statement primarily used in Unit Testing that allows you to validate that the value of a variable is what you expect it to be.

Assign,Assigning a value to a variable means that you are giving a value to be stored by that variable.,C#,
Associative table,"An associative table is a table in a database that is used to resolve a many-to-many relationship.

A relational database cannot directly resolve a many-to-many relationship, so an associative table (often called a joiner table) is used to create two (2)  one-to-many relationships.",Databases,
Asymmetric encryption,"A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: 

public keys which may be disseminated widely 

private keys which are known only to the owner

This is theprimary encryption used in internet communications",Security,
Asynchronous code,"Code that doesn't necessarily run from top to bottom.

Asynchronous means that we can run code in parallel. And multiple tasks can be processed at the same time. When an asynchronous process is completed, the results are returned to the main thread.

This is what we do in JavaScript when we make a call to a WebAPI - The website can continue to process while we wait on the results from the API.",JS,
Attribute,Often used interchangeably with property,,
Autoboxing,"Boxing is when value type (primitive in Java) needs to be stored on the heap.

5 is an integer, and is managed on the stack.

int? is a reference type (Nullable<int>) and is managed on the heap.

The following code takes an int and boxes it into a reference type.
int? number = 5;

Unboxing is a similar operation but in the opposite direction.",OOP,
Automated testing,Running testing code that either simulates user interactions with the program being tested or directly calls the methods of the program being tested,Testing,

SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 20",Databases,
BigO notation,"BigO notation is a pre-defined set of metrics that allows you to specify the efficiency of an algorithm.

The notation takes into account 2 things
- Time complexity: how long does the code take to run
- Space complexity: how much memory is required to run the algorithm

All algorithms can run quickly with small datasets, the question that BigO notation answers is, how efficient will it be with large datasets (at scale)

The bottom line... is your process fast enough?",Algorithms,
Binary search,A searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half,Collections,
Block,"A grouped/contained section of code that performs a certain action or actions.

Variables declared within a block of code are only accessible within that block. This is called scope.",C#,

Booleans are used to make decisions in programming. They are used in if, while or for statements.",C#,
Branch,"Branches are used in git repositories and allow you to change code in a sandboxed environment. 

This means that you can change code without affecting the base code.

Once you are finished changing your code, you can merge the changes to the base branch.",Git,
Browser,"A tool for navigating the internet (""browsing"" its contents)",Web,
Bug,"A bug in your code is an error in your logic.

The term comes from the early days in computing when an operator of the Mark II traced an error back to a moth that was trapped in a relay. The ""bug"" was removed from the relay and taped to the log book.

And that moth became the first bog in programming.",Code,
byte,A byte is an 8-bit numeric data type used to hold integers (-128 to 127),C#,
C: drive,The core of a computer's hard disk containing its operating system and related system files,Windows,

int littleNumber = (int)bigNumber;",C#,
char (character),A value type (primitive in Java) data type that holds a single character,C#,
Child class,"A class that inherits from another class (the parent or base class)

The child inherits all of the properties and functionality of the base class, and therefore IS the same type as the base class. This is what is meant by an IS-A relationship.

A CheckingAccount IS-A BankAccount. Therefore without writing any additional code a CheckingAccount has all of the capabilities of a BankAccount. The code within the CheckingAccount then focuses on what makes CheckingAccount different from any other BankAccount.",OOP,
Child element,HTML works on a hierarchical structure. Elements can be nested within other HTML elements. This is a parent-child relationship. A child is then a descendant of its parent.,HTML,
Class,"A class is a blueprint of what an object can become. It is a template that defines a new DataType.

Just like a blueprint of a house can not be used like a real house, a class in C# cannot be use like a real object. It is a template that must first be created before it can be used.

A class defines what information (variables) and functionality (methods) the object will have, once it has been created.",OOP,
Clause (WHERE Clause),A WHERE clause is a conditional statement that is used to specify how the results of a query will be filtered.,SQL,
